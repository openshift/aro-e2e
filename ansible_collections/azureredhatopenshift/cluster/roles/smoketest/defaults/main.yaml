# This file serves as the canonical place for default variable values in this role,
# per Ansible's [standard role directory structure](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/playbook_guide/playbooks_reuse_roles.html#role-directory-structure).
# Placing defaults in `roles/${role_name}/defaults/main.yaml` is the preferred way to define low-priority (i.e. easily overridable) role variables.
# These can be overridden by:
# * Extra vars (`-e`)
# * Environment vars passed via Makefile
# * Vars defined in playbooks, inventory, or host/group vars
